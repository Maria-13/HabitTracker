# HabitTracker
UPD: this is a new iteration of the project which includes user's view after logging into the system and allows to create/add habits (with js queries). The calendar and steaks views are omitted as possible steps for future iterations.

Problem statement: new habits can improve the quality of our lives and sometimes can change our life experience. However, it can be challenging to maintain new habits for a long period of time. When we're trying to set new habits, we have to deal with a lot of resistance. To make this easier, we need a feedback loop.

Solution: a habit tracker can help us track how well you're sticking with daily, weekly, or monthly habits. A tracking system gives us an opportunity to create/add habits and build a system that we can rely on. Without any accountability, we increase the likelihood of forgetting about our new habits altogether. Having a tracking system helps us stay committed. Tracking your habits on a daily basis gives you a sense of everyday accomplishment.

App description: it's a web-based application that allows you to create/add new habits; choose how often you want to do things to form a habit; edit/delete your habits.
